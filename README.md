## Introduction
The **Flexibility Function (FF)** algorithm is designed to represent flexibility dynamics. This utilizes a stochastic nonlinear differential equation for modeling dynamic demand in response to price deviations.
It uses **I-spline** basis functions to construct functions *g(U)*, which capture the relation between price and flexibility state. It also utilizes a polynomial of order 6 to construct the function *f(X)* for state equations.  

Key features include:  
- Maximum likelihood approach for parameter estimation with **SciPy optimization**
- Solvers: SLSQP, Nelder-Mead, L-BFGS-B
- Using multiple initial values for optimization problem solving   
- Validation with RÂ² and RMSE metrics  
- Visualization of intermediate functions and final predictions
